# Collision-detection-and-blinker-light-project-
In this group project, me and my group members (Juan Alveraz (https://github.com/KilloPillers), Esther Chang, and Veronica Hangsan) developed a system to improve vehicle safety using two Arduino circuits. 

This systems promotes defensive driving by warning a tailgater that they are at an unsafe distance from the driver. As a tailgater gets closer to the driver, the adaptive taillights will begin to flash to alert and capture thier attention. This reduces accidents due to inattentive and distracted driving. The taillights also have an attention-grabbing sequential blinker sequence. This function can be activated using the IR remote. 

This system also features a collision detection system for the driver. If the system detects a collision risk where the distance between the driver and the car in front are approaching each other at an unsafe rate, the system will activate and engage emergency braking. The sensitivity can be adjusted in three modes as well using the IR remote. If needed, the system can also be turned off. 

More details and demonstrations can be found in the video provided.
